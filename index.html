          Want to play a fun catching game to pass some time? This is a game I
          made for my summer homework in AP Computer Science. The game is a
          catching game, and when you catch the items you get a point. My goal
          was to end the game when you reach 50 points, and I accomplished this
          by coding the game to freeze once a certain amount of points was
          reached. It was challenging because at the time, I hadnâ€™t coded with a
          language in a while. But, I was able to get some practice with the
          lessons for the homework prior to making this game.

          This is a project in AP Computer Science that I made with a partner with Python. It is a very simple game that involves inputting numbers to place either an X or O, just like a traditional game of TicTacToe. You play against the computer, which at first was extremely difficult to understand how to code. But this was a good challenge to improve our coding skills.

          This drawing app that I created with Morgan Stovold and Francesco
          Campanile has the tools needed to successfully draw. Our goal was to
          make a drawing app that has all of the necessary tools using snap. It
          was a long process, and it was very challenging at times, but with the
          3 of us working on it we were able to code it correctly. You have
          multiple colors and sizes to choose from, an eraser tool, shape tools,
          and asterisk tools.

        <h2>Pico Traffic Light Project</h2>
        <p>
          Me and my partner learned how to operate a Rasberry Pi Pico. We synced it with our PC, then used Python Code to operate a traffic sign, which would start at red, then switch to green, then yellow every few seconds. We connected the Rasberry Pi Pico to a ring light. The picture shows the ring at red, or stop.
